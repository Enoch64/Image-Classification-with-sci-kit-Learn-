# Image-Classification-with-sci-kit-Learn
## Project Description
This program performs a binary and multi-class classification task on the MNIST dataset. This data set is a collection of 30,000 images of hand written digits from 0 to 9. The machine learning agorithms used in this classification task were Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forests. The algorithms, data set splitting and error analysis like cross validation were implemented with inbuilt functions and methods from Sci-Kit Learn. Matplotlib was used to visualize the confusion matrices and handwritten digits. 

## Motivation for this project 
A genuine interest in Machine Learning and AI motivated me to do this project. After reading chapter 2 of reference (ii) which explored a regression task of predicting housing prices, I was interested in trying another common Machine Learning Task i.e. binary and multi-class classification. A few challenges I faced along way was learning the inbuilt functions of Sci-Kit Learn, learning the in built functionof Matplotlib to make clear visualization of the data set. Another challenge was chosing the classification algorithm, reference (ii) suggested Stochastic Gradient Descent to start with. I then decided to try Random Forest and was susprised with how much the accuracy improved. Other algorithms such as Neural Networks were far to advanced for me to understand
